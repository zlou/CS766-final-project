## Introduction
This project is aiming at: 
 - Integrate state-of-art binocular disparity estimation algorithms to multiview disparity estimation.
 - Implement neural networks to determine the views to use for every pixel.

## Why disparity estimation is important
Stereo estimation is a fundamental computer vision: <br>
Given two images for the same scene from different views, compute the disparity for each pixel and then generate depth map, from which we can form a 3D scene. <br>
Following is a figure showing the left-right view of a 3D scene and two depth map they generated. <br>

## Binocular vs. Multi-view disparity
Introduction and details about to Binocur and Multi-view disparity can be found in folder "/PPT_slides/Intro_disparity.pptx" <br> <br>
Binocular disparity is just 1-D estimation which may ignore some vertical information. Â <br>
Multi-view disparity is a nature extension of binocular method at 2-D estimation, which uses more than two images and thus usually would get better performance. <br>

## Multi-view Selection
However, multi-view disparity estimating method often yields noisy, spurious disparity maps due to occlusions, scene discontinuity, imperfect light balance and other disturbance. <br>
The following picture is the performance using different number of views to generate disparity map for a specific 3D scene. <br>
As can be seen from the curve, when number of views increases, the performance first get better and reach a min point on the curve. When number of views keeps increasing, the performance however, drops a little afterwards. <br>
This tells us that we only need to select some of the views to reach best performance. And this is the problem we are going to solve in this project.
